The correct approach is to use `preg_replace`, which uses the PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) engine.  This engine offers better handling of special characters and provides more robust pattern matching capabilities.  The following code replaces the deprecated code with `preg_replace`, providing the expected and intended behavior:
```php
<?php
$string = "I like apple and apple pie";
$replacedString = preg_replace('/apple/', 'orange', $string);
echo $replacedString; // Output: I like orange and orange pie
?>
```
This version correctly replaces all occurrences of 'apple' with 'orange' without issues related to special characters.
