This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue with PHP's `ereg` functions, which are deprecated and prone to unexpected behavior.  The `ereg_replace` function is used to replace occurrences of 'apple' with 'orange', but due to the lack of proper escaping of special characters, it may not work as intended if the input string contains special characters that have meaning within the regular expression context.
